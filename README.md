Slothbot just got an upgrade!

## How to..
* On windows get [openssl (the installer for developers)](https://slproweb.com/products/Win32OpenSSL.html).
* Set the `INCLUDE` and `LIBPATH` environment variables to point to the `<openssl dir>\include` folder.
* Add a `config.json` containing the `bot_token`.
* Run with `cargo run/build` from the root directory.
